-> The same key would be used for both encryption and decryption of the data in a file.

-> Key should be kept safe and not be misplaced or sent to an unauthorized person.

-> The default name and extension of the key will be key and .key respectively. 

-> You can change the name of the key manually but the extension should not be altered.

-> Every content (file to be encrypted/decrypted and key) should be in the same folder where you will keep the application.

-> Provide the name of the file along with extension whose content you want to encrypt.

    # Decryption
 -> Decryption part of the app will be used to convert the data back to the plain text.
 
 -> You will have to provide the same key with which data was encrypted initially.
 
 -> Make sure to enter the correct name and extension of the key.

 -> After that provide the name of the file whose content you want to decrypt.
 
 -> You will see a prompt that would mark the completion of the decryption process.
